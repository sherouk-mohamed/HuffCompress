# huffcompress

## Overview  
This C++ project implements Huffman encoding for image compression and decompression.  
It efficiently reduces file size by encoding image data into binary format and reconstructing it from the compressed file.  

## Project Modules  

### 1. Preprocessing Module  
- Reads and processes the input image in binary format.  

### 2. Feature Extraction/Selection Module  
- Analyzes character frequency and builds a Huffman tree.  

### 3. Model Selection and Training Module  
- Generates Huffman codes for compression.  

### 4. Performance Analysis Module  
- Evaluates compression ratio and accuracy of decompression.  

## Results  
- Successfully compresses and decompresses images using Huffman encoding.  
- Reduces image file size while maintaining reconstructability.
